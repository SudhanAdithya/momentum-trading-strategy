1. Purpose
The purpose of this memo is to provide stakeholders with a summary of the momentum-based equity trading project. 
The project aims to automate the ingestion, preprocessing, and analysis of U.S. equities data to identify top-performing stocks based on historical momentum and implement a systematic, rules-based trading strategy.

2. Primary Stakeholders
Quantitative Traders & Portfolio Managers
Responsible for making informed investment decisions and evaluating systematic trading strategies. 
Their primary interest is actionable signals, performance metrics, and risk insights.

3. Key Deliverables
Automated data ingestion and preprocessing pipeline for U.S. equities.
Momentum-based backtesting framework evaluating strategy performance against the S&P 500.
Interactive dashboard displaying cumulative returns, Sharpe ratio, maximum drawdown, and hit rate.
Documentation detailing methodology, assumptions, and operational workflow.

4. Metrics of Success
Strategy Sharpe ratio exceeds benchmark or demonstrates risk-adjusted outperformance.
Cumulative return meets or exceeds S&P 500 benchmark over backtest period.
Maximum drawdown remains within acceptable limits relative to risk appetite.
Hit rate (positive return frequency) â‰¥ 50% across rebalancing periods.

5. Assumptions & Constraints
Data from public APIs (e.g., yFinance) is accurate and complete.
Strategy universe is limited to U.S. equities, primarily S&P 500 constituents.
Historical backtest may not reflect future performance; live trading carries additional risk.
Computational constraints limit dataset size and backtest frequency.
